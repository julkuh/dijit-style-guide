# dijit-style-guide
A nicer way to present dojo's default Theme-Tester. It allows to edit style-guide.html and livereload the page in browser after editing it. Currently the `style-guide.html` is only a copy of dijit's theme-tester.html. In future it will be a more modern and user friendly test-page to show-off all of the awesome Dojo Features.

## Getting Started

1. Install globally with npm `bower` and `grunt-cli`.
2. Run `bower install` and `npm install`to install Dojo and Grunt dependencies.
3. Run `grunt` to open the Dijit theme tester.
4. When changing the file `style-guide.html` the page should about itself due to lifereload in browser.
